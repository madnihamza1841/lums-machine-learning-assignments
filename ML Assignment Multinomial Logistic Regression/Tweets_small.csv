negative,@SouthwestAir too Late Flight now
negative,"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
negative,@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
negative,@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G

negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
negative,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff

positive,@USAirways thanks so much!
positive,@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.

neutral,@USAirways how's us 1797 looking today?
negative,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
neutral,@JetBlue I clear that folder regularly and JetBlue is white listed so it never got to me.
negative,@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
neutral,@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao

negative,@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
negative,@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...

negative,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?

negative,.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
negative,@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
